2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to Reclaim Protocol and to recipients of software distributed by Reclaim Protocol a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Your Contributions and such derivative works.

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to Reclaim Protocol and to recipients of software distributed by Reclaim Protocol a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your Contribution(s) alone or by combination of Your Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted.

4. Representations and Warranties. You represent that You are legally entitled to grant the above license. If Your employer(s) has rights to intellectual property that You create that includes Your Contributions, You represent that You have received permission to make Contributions on behalf of that employer, that Your employer has waived such rights for Your Contributions to Reclaim Protocol, or that Your employer has executed a separate Corporate CLA with Reclaim Protocol.

5. Original Creation. You represent that each of Your Contributions is Your original creation. You represent that Your Contribution submissions include complete details of any third-party license or other restriction of which You are personally aware and which are associated with any part of Your Contributions.

You may provide support for free, for a fee, or not at all. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, You provide Your Contributions on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.

7. Third-Party Submissions. Should You wish to submit work that is not Your original creation, You may submit it to Reclaim Protocol separately from any Contribution, identifying the complete details of its source and of any license or other restriction of which You are personally aware, and conspicuously marking the work as "Submitted on behalf of a third-party: [named here]".

8. Notification of Changes. You agree to notify Reclaim Protocol of any facts or circumstances of which You become aware that would make these representations inaccurate in any respect.

9. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of [Insert appropriate jurisdiction], without regard to its conflict of laws principles.
