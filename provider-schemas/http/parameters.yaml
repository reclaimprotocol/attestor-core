      which portions to select from a response.
      These are selected in order, xpath => jsonPath => regex
      *
      These redactions are done client side and only the selected
      portions are sent to the attestor. The attestor will only be able
      to see the selected portions alongside the first line of the HTTP
      response (i.e. "HTTP/1.1 200 OK")
      *
      To disable any redactions, pass an empty array
    items:

          type: string
          nullable: true

        hash:
          type: string
          description: >-
            If provided, the value inside will be hashed instead of being
            redacted. Useful for cases where the data inside is an identifiying
            piece of information that you don't want to reveal to the attestor, eg.
            an email address.

            If the hash function produces more bytes than the original value,
            the hash will be truncated.

            Eg. if hash is enabled, the original value is "hello", and hashed
            is "a1b2c", then the attestor will only see "a1b2c".

            Note: if a regex with named groups is provided, only
            the named groups will be hashed.

      This value will NOT be included in provider hash
